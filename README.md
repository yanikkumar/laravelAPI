# Laravel API with DockerSetup
Working on API development with Laravel with some new updates and feature in laravel 11

## Info to Run the Project
Docker must be installed in the system.

- Run the docker setup.
- Open the terminal inside the project and run the command `docker-compose up` 
    This will run the containers with php server and frontend and db all together.
- To make any comman inside the project open the shell inside docker first by executing `docker-compose exec backend sh` and artisan commands can be run in the shell.
